# BeyBay

## Overview

In this activity, you'll be creating an storefront for Justin Bieber themed merchandise with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
